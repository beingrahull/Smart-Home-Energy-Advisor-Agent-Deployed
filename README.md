# Smart-Home-Energy-Advisor-Agent

⚡ Overview<br>
An intelligent AI-powered agent designed to interpret electricity bills, analyze energy consumption patterns, and provide smart recommendations for optimizing usage and reducing costs. With built-in reasoning and adaptive capabilities, it not only responds to input—but learns and improves suggestions over time.

🚀 Features<br>
📄 Parses electricity bills and extracts usage data

📈 Analyzes historical consumption patterns to identify inefficiencies

🧠 Uses semantic understanding to correlate usage with potential savings

🗺️ Visualizes trends to support energy decision-making

🧪 Suggests customized tips based on user patterns

☁️ Deployable on IBM Cloud with optional integration for scalability

🔍 Why choose this Agent?<br>
Most households receive electricity bills but lack insights into what drives usage patterns or cost spikes. Traditional billing formats are difficult to interpret, and energy-saving decisions often lack data-driven guidance. This agent aims to demystify billing data and deliver actionable intelligence to help users optimize energy usage and reduce monthly costs with minimal effort.

🧪 Agentic Behavior<br>
This agent isn't just reactive—it’s proactive. Inspired by Agentic AI principles, it incorporates:

🎯 Goal-Oriented Recommendations: Suggests actions based on defined savings or efficiency targets

🔁 Feedback Loops: Learns from previous consumption data and user behavior to refine future recommendations

⚙️ Adaptability: Capable of modifying its analysis approach based on changes in user input or utility structure

📡 Scalable Autonomy: Future scope includes integration with IoT devices and smart home systems for real-time adjustments

🛠️ Future Enhancements<br>
Features planned to increase autonomy and value:

🧾 OCR capability for scanned or photographed bill inputs

🏷️ Support for multiple utility providers and bill formats

📲 Integration with smart appliances and home automation for automated responses

🌱 Sustainability dashboard with carbon footprint estimates and eco tips

🔗 RAG-based retrieval system for dynamic energy recommendations based on global best practices
